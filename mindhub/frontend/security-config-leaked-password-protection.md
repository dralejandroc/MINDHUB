# üîê Security Configuration: Leaked Password Protection

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Leaked Password Protection Disabled

**Current Status**: Supabase Auth leaked password protection is **DISABLED**

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Users can register with compromised passwords

**Impact**: Users might use passwords that have been leaked in data breaches, making accounts vulnerable to credential stuffing attacks.

## üéØ What is Leaked Password Protection?

Supabase Auth can check user passwords against the **HaveIBeenPwned.org** database of compromised passwords. This prevents users from using passwords that have been exposed in data breaches.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Enable (Manual Configuration Required)

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Settings**
3. Find **"Password Security"** section
4. Toggle **"Enable leaked password protection"** to ON
5. Save changes

### Option 2: Supabase CLI

```bash
supabase projects api-keys list
supabase auth update --leaked-password-protection=true
```

### Option 3: Management API

```bash
curl -X PATCH \
  https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_REF/config/auth \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "SECURITY_HIBP_ENABLED": true
  }'
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits After Enabling

- **Prevents compromised passwords**: Users cannot register with known leaked passwords
- **Reduces account takeover risk**: Protects against credential stuffing attacks
- **Compliance**: Meets security best practices for password policies
- **User education**: Informs users when their password has been compromised

## üö® Important Notes

### For MindHub Platform:

1. **Medical Data Protection**: Healthcare platforms need stronger password security
2. **HIPAA Compliance**: Leaked password protection helps meet security requirements
3. **Professional Users**: Doctors and healthcare professionals need secure accounts
4. **Patient Privacy**: Compromised accounts could expose sensitive medical information

### Implementation Impact:

- **No performance impact**: Checking happens during registration/password change only
- **User experience**: Users with compromised passwords will be asked to choose a new one
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing users keep their current passwords until they change them

## üìã Action Required

**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**: Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard

**Priority**: MEDIUM (should be done within 1-2 days)

**Estimated Time**: 2 minutes

**Steps**:
1. Open Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to Auth ‚Üí Settings
3. Enable "Leaked password protection"
4. Verify setting is active

## üîç Verification

After enabling, you can verify by:

1. Checking the Auth settings page shows "Enabled"
2. Testing with a known compromised password (like "password123")
3. Confirming the registration is blocked with appropriate error message
