		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Infrastructure and Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Google App Engine setup, Auth0 configuration, React/Next.js initialization, microservices architecture, environment configuration, and CI/CD pipeline into detailed implementation steps. Include specific Auth0 flows for each Hub, routing structure, and GitHub Actions workflow configuration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technologies (GAE, Auth0, React/Next.js, Node.js), four separate Hub integrations, SSO requirements, and CI/CD setup. Requires careful coordination of authentication across multiple services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Database and Storage Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the setup of Cloud SQL schemas for Expedix, Firestore collections for Formx and Resources, Cloud Storage bucket configuration, IAM policies, encryption implementation, and NOM-024-SSA3-2010 compliance requirements for each data store.",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to three different storage systems (Cloud SQL, Firestore, Cloud Storage), compliance requirements, security configurations, and encryption needs. Each system requires specific schema design and access controls."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Internal API (Integrix)",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into specific API endpoint groups for patient data, clinical assessments, forms, and resources. Include middleware development, authentication integration, API documentation setup, versioning strategy, rate limiting implementation, and inter-service communication patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this is the central nervous system connecting all Hubs. Requires careful API design, comprehensive error handling, security implementation, and must support all data flows between services."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Clinimetrix Core System",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 16,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into universal interface development, implementation of each clinical scale category, scoring algorithm development, self/hetero-administered modes, tokenized link system, secure storage implementation, and results visualization components. Group the 50+ scales by type.",
			"reasoning": "Extremely complex due to 50+ clinical instruments, each with unique scoring algorithms and validation requirements. Requires medical accuracy, multiple administration modes, secure token system, and sophisticated visualization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Expedix Patient Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into patient database schema, consultation history tracking, prescription search system, drug catalog management, prescription generation with QR codes, digital signature implementation, patient tagging system, and print formatting features.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to medical record requirements, prescription security features (QR codes, digital signatures), drug catalog integration, and regulatory compliance needs for medical prescriptions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Formx Form Builder System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into drag-and-drop editor components, field type implementations, PDF import parser, JotForm compatibility layer, Firestore template storage, public link generation, response collection system, and email integration features.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to visual editor requirements, PDF parsing capabilities, JotForm compatibility needs, and integration with patient records. Form builders require sophisticated UI interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Resources Library System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into resource catalog structure, Firestore schema design, secure download implementation, version control system, search/filter functionality, access logging, and batch upload interface for administrators.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it's primarily a content management system with security features. Main challenges are version control implementation and secure access management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Interface and UX Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down by Hub-specific UI needs, shared component library, tablet-optimized layouts, accessibility implementation, navigation system, loading/error states, and responsive design patterns. Include specific WCAG 2.1 AA compliance features.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity spread across multiple Hubs. Requires careful attention to accessibility standards, tablet optimization, and consistent design patterns across different functional areas."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate NOM-024 Compliance and Security Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail HL7/IHE standards implementation, encryption setup for each data store, comprehensive audit logging system, backup procedures, recovery protocols, penetration testing framework, and session management policies across all services.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to strict Mexican healthcare compliance requirements, multiple security layers, and need to implement across all system components. Requires deep understanding of healthcare standards."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy and Configure Production Environment",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into GAE F2 instance configuration, monitoring setup with specific metrics, alerting rules, backup automation, disaster recovery procedures, load balancing configuration, SSL certificate setup, and user training material preparation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity focused on DevOps and operational concerns. Main challenges are ensuring proper scaling, monitoring setup, and preparing comprehensive training for healthcare professionals."
