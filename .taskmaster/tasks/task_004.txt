Successfully implemented the Universal Clinical Scale Interface Architecture with comprehensive TypeScript types supporting 50+ clinical scales. Built BaseScale abstract class with plugin architecture, ClinimetrixApiClient for backend operations, and React Context for state management. Created core components including ScaleList for browsing/filtering, AssessmentSession for session management, and AssessmentInterface for universal assessment taking. Updated main Clinimetrix page with dashboard, scales, and sessions views. Architecture supports self-administered, hetero-administered, and hybrid assessment modes with real-time progress tracking, auto-save, and comprehensive scoring systems. Foundation complete and ready for implementing specific clinical scales.
